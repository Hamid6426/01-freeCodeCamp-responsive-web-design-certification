    <header class="main-header">Introduction to HTML</header>
    <p>In the vast landscape of web development, HTML stands as the cornerstone upon which the entire structure of the World Wide Web is built. HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, provides the structure and framework for web pages, defining the content and how it is displayed in a web browser. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a complete novice, understanding HTML is essential for anyone venturing into the world of web development.
    </p>
    <header>What is HTML?</header>
    <p>HTML is a markup language used to create and structure the content of web pages. It consists of a series of elements, which are represented by tags enclosed in angle brackets. These tags define the structure and semantics of the content. For example, p tags are used to denote paragraphs, h1 to h6 tags represent headings of varying sizes, and ul and li tags are used to create unordered lists.</p>
    
    <header>Anatomy of an HTML Document</header>
    <p>Every HTML document follows a basic structure consisting of the following elements:    </p>
    <code>
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
        &lt;html&gt;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;head&gt;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title&gt;Document Title&lt;/title&gt;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/head&gt;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;body&gt;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h1&gt;Heading&lt;/h1&gt;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p&gt;Paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/body&gt;
        &lt;/html&gt;
    </code>
    
    <p>DOCTYPE html: This declaration specifies the HTML version being used, which in this case is HTML5.</p>
    <p>html: The root element of an HTML document, encapsulating all other elements.</p>
    <p>head: Contains meta-information about the document, such as its title, links to external resources, and metadata.</p>
    <p>title: Sets the title of the document, which is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.</p>
    <p>body: The main content of the document resides within this element.</p>

    <header>Example HTML Code</header>
    <p>Here is An example of a simple HTML page:</p>
    <code>
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
        &lt;html lang="en"&gt;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;head&gt;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title&gt;My First Web Page&lt;/title&gt;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/head&gt;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;body&gt;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h1&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/h1&gt;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p&gt;This is my first web page&lt;/p&gt;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/body&gt;
        &lt;/html&gt;
    </code>

    <header>Conclusion</header>
    <p>HTML serves as the foundation of web development, providing the structure and organization necessary for creating web pages. While the examples provided here are basic, HTML is capable of much more, including embedding multimedia, creating forms, and defining the layout of a page through CSS and dynamic effects using Javascript.</p>

<section id="Introduction_to_CSS" class="main-section">
    <header class="main-header">Introduction to CSS</header>
    <p>While HTML lays down the structure and content of a web page, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) steps in to add the aesthetic appeal, making websites visually engaging and user-friendly. CSS allows developers to control the presentation and layout of HTML elements, defining everything from colors and fonts to spacing and positioning. Let's embark on a journey into the world of CSS to understand its fundamentals and how it enhances the web experience.</p>
    
    <header>What is CSS?</header>
    <p>CSS is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML. It works by associating style rules with HTML elements, specifying how they should be displayed in the browser. With CSS, developers can create visually stunning websites, customize the appearance of individual elements, and ensure consistency across multiple pages.</p>
    <header>Anatomy of a CSS Rule</header>
    <p>A CSS rule consists of a selector and one or more declarations, which define the styling properties of the selected elements. Here's a basic example:</p>
    <code>
        selector {
        property: value;
    }
    </code>
    <p>Selector: Specifies which HTML elements the rule applies to. It can be an element type, class, ID, or other attribute.</p>
    <p>Property: Defines the aspect of the element that is being styled, such as color, font-size, or margin.</p>
    <p>Value: Specifies the value of the property being set, such as a specific color or size.</p>

    <header>Example</header>
    <p>Here is a simple example of how a CSS page look like:</p>
    <code>
    body {
        font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
        background-color: #f0f0f0;
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
    }
    
    h1 {
        color: #333;
    }
    
    p {
        font-size: 16px;
        line-height: 1.5;
    }
    
    ul {
        list-style-type: none;
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
    }
    
    li {
        margin-bottom: 10px;
    }</code>

        <p>In this CSS code:
        <p>We set the font family for the entire document to Arial or a fallback sans-serif.
        <p>The background color of the body is set to a light gray.</p>
        <p>Headings h1 are styled with a dark gray color.</p>
        <p>Paragraphs p have a font size of 16 pixels and a line height of 1.5 times the font size.</p>
        <p>Unordered lists ul have their default bullet points removed and margins and padding reset to zero.</p>
        <p>List items li have a margin-bottom of 10 pixels to create space between them.</p>

    <header>Linking CSS to HTML</header>
    <p>To apply the styles defined in the CSS file to our HTML document, we need to link them together. This is done using the link element within the head section of the HTML document:</p>
    
    <code>
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
        &lt;html&gt;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;head&gt;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title&gt;Document Title&lt;/title&gt;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;link rel='stylesheet' href='style.css'&gt;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/head&gt;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;body&gt;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h1&gt;Heading&lt;/h1&gt;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p&gt;Paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/body&gt;
        &lt;/html&gt;
    </code>

    <header>Conclusion</header>
    <p>CSS plays a crucial role in web development, allowing developers to transform plain HTML documents into visually appealing and well-designed websites. By understanding the basics of CSS, you gain the power to control the look and feel of your web pages, ensuring a positive user experience for your audience. As you continue your journey in web development, mastering CSS will open up endless possibilities for creativity and innovation in your projects.

<section id="Introduction_to_Javascript" class="main-section">
    <header class="main-header">Introduction to Javascript</header>
    <p>In the ever-evolving landscape of web development, JavaScript stands as a powerhouse, enabling dynamic and interactive experiences on the web. As the programming language of the web, JavaScript allows developers to add functionality, manipulate content, and respond to user actions in real-time. Let's embark on a journey into the world of JavaScript to understand its fundamentals and its pivotal role in shaping modern web development.</p>

    <header>What is JavaScript?</header>
    <p>JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used for client-side scripting in web development. It enables developers to create interactive elements, handle events, manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model), and communicate with servers to dynamically update content without reloading the entire page. JavaScript is supported by all major web browsers and has become an integral part of web development alongside HTML and CSS.</p>

    <header>Basics of JavaScript</header>
    <p>JavaScript code consists of statements that are executed by the browser's JavaScript engine. Here are some fundamental concepts:</p>
    <p>Variables: Used to store data values. Variables can be declared using the var, let, or const keywords.</p>
    <p>Data Types: JavaScript supports various data types such as numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, objects, and more.</p>
    <p>Functions: Blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. Functions are declared using the function keyword.</p>
    <p>Control Flow: JavaScript provides constructs like if...else, switch, for loops, while loops, etc., to control the flow of execution.</p>
    <p>DOM Manipulation: JavaScript allows developers to interact with the DOM, enabling dynamic changes to the content and structure of web pages.</p>


    <header>Example JavaScript Code</header>
    <p>
        Here is a simple example to illustrate how JavaScript can be used to add interactivity to a web page:
    </p>

    <code>
        function changeColor() {
            var paragraph = document.getElementById("myParagraph");
            paragraph.style.color = "red";
        }
    </code>
    <p>In this JavaScript code:</p>
    <p>We define a function changeColor() that changes the text color of a paragraph element with the id myParagraph to red.</p>
    <p>The document.getElementById() method is used to select the paragraph element from the DOM.</p>
    <p>We then access the style property of the paragraph element to modify its CSS properties, in this case, the color property.</p>

    <header>Linking JavaScript to HTML</header>
    <p>To incorporate JavaScript into an HTML document, we can either embed the code directly within script tags or link an external JavaScript file:</p>
    
    <code>
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
        &lt;html&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;
            &lt;title&gt;My JavaScript Web Page&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
            &lt;p id="myParagraph"&gt;Click the button to change my color!&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;button onclick="changeColor()"&gt;Change Color&lt;/button&gt;
            
            &lt;script&gt;
                function changeColor() {
                    var paragraph = document.getElementById("myParagraph");
                    paragraph.style.color = "red";
                }
            &lt;/script&gt;<br>
        &lt;/body&gt;
        &lt;/html&gt;
    </code>

    <p>In this HTML document:</p>
    <p>We have a paragraph element with the id myParagraph and a button that triggers the changeColor() function when clicked. </p>
    <p>The onclick attribute of the button is set to call the changeColor() function. </p>
    <p>The JavaScript code is embedded within script tags in the body section of the HTML document. </p>
    

    <header>Conclusion</header>
    <p>JavaScript empowers developers to create dynamic and interactive web applications that engage users and enhance their browsing experience. By mastering the fundamentals of JavaScript, you gain the ability to add interactivity, handle user input, and manipulate web page content in real-time. As you continue your journey into web development, JavaScript will be your faithful companion, enabling you to build innovative and immersive web experiences.</p>
